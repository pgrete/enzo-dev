This is a cosmology simulation identical to AMRCosmology, except using 
the Grackle to solve the cooling.  See the documentation 
for more information on running with Grackle.

This simulation runs to z = 0 with tabulated primordial and metal
cooling from Grackle and conventional, non-radiative star formation and
feedback.  It will run on 2 processors in about 40 minutes.

To run this, you will need to copy the file, CloudyData_UVB=HM2012.h5, 
from the input directory of your Grackle source, to the run directory
of the simulation.

Usage:
./inits.exe -d AMRCosmology_Grackle.inits
mpirun -np 2 ./ring.exe pv ParticlePositions ParticleVelocities
mpirun -np 2 ./enzo.exe -d AMRCosmology_Grackle.enzo
